        <h2>My Mission</h2>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started learning web development because I wanted to understand how
          websites actually work instead of just using them. I am continuously
          improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub through daily
          practice and real projects.
